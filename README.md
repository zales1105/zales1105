# Welcome to My Programming Journey üöÄ

## Introduction
Hi there! üëã I'm just starting my journey in programming, and I'm excited to share my progress with the world. My primary focus is on learning Python, one of the most popular and versatile programming languages out there. Whether you're here to follow my progress, contribute, or offer advice, you're most welcome!

## About This Repository
This repository is a collection of my Python projects, exercises, and notes as I learn and grow as a programmer. I‚Äôll be starting with the basics and gradually working my way up to more complex topics. Here‚Äôs a general idea of what you can expect to find:

1. **Basic Python Syntax:** My first steps, learning how to write Python code, and understanding the fundamentals.
2. **Projects and Exercises:** Small projects and coding exercises that help me practice what I've learned.
3. **Notes and Resources:** My personal notes, useful links, and resources that I find helpful along the way.

## Current Progress
### üå± I'm currently learning:
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Control Structures (if statements, loops)
- Functions and Modules

### üî® Projects I'm working on:
- A simple calculator
- Basic text-based games (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors)
- Solving problems from coding challenge websites

## How to Use This Repository
Feel free to browse through the code, check out the projects, and provide feedback! If you're also a beginner, you might find the notes and exercises useful.
